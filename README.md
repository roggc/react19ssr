# Project ready to develop with React 19 (Typescript or Javascript)

This project can be created with **`npx create-react19-app@latest my-app`**.

This is a project ready to develop with **React 19**. Specifically with **Server Functions**. With the use of Server Functions and **Suspense** you can fetch data from the Server once in the **Client**, so there is no need for Server Components then (if you don't care about SEO).

This project is ready to develop either in **Typescript** or **Javascript**. If an `app.tsx` is found, then it will take preference over a possible `app.jsx` or `app.js`. There must be at least an `app.tsx` or `app.jsx` (or `app.js`).

The app is developed in the `src` folder. The `setup` folder has the `server.js` and `client.js` files. The `server.js` file is the one executed by `node`. It defines to endpoints, one `/`, which serves the `index.html` file from `public` folder (this folder is generated by Webpack). The other endpoint is `/react` and is fetched by the React component rendered in the `root` div of the html file (this is the purpose of the `client.js` file). This endpoint serves the React 19 App developed in the `src` folder.

To start the app in development mode you must run `npm run dev`. This will execute Webpack in watch mode and will start the app with the `node` command. It uses the package `concurrently` to execute both in parallel. The server is faster to be ready than Webpack, so when executing the command wait for Webpack log to show and then you can navigate to the page (`localhost:3000`).

There is no hot reloading, so when you do changes to the code, you have to reload yourself the page to see those changes.

The project has the package [react-enhanced-suspense](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-enhanced-suspense) installed. It is an enhanced `Suspense` that works as React's `Suspense` if no extra props are used.

This project is inspired by [this other project](https://github.com/adamjberg/react-server-components).
